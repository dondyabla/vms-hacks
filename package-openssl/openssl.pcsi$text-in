1 RUN_IVP
=prompt Run the installation verification procedure?
Running the installation verification procedure is optional.  The
procedure takes a very short while, checking that basic function
works correctly.  If not run during installation, this procedure
should be run as part of the post installation tasks.


1 POST
=prompt Post installation tasks.
After installation, there remains a few tasks to be performed:

    1. Make sure the OSSL startup file is executed.

    2. Check the default OpenSSL configuration file and update it
       if necessary.

    3. Running the installation verification procedure (IVP)


This installation created the following directory structure in
PCSI$DESTINATION (default to SYS$SYSDEVICE:[VMS$COMMON]):

    [OSSL$COMMON]               The common SSL directory, contains the
                                default OpenSSL configuration file
    [OSSL$COMMON.CERTS]         The default certificate store
    [OSSL$COMMON.PRIVATE]       The default private key store

    [OSSL$ENGINES{- vstring2()-}]
    [OSSL$ENGINES{- vstring2()-}32]         Default engine stores
    [OSSL$ENGINES{- vstring2()-}64]

    [OSSL$INCLUDE.OPENSSL]      Contains the C header files

    [SYS$STARTUP]               Startup and shutdown command procedures
    [SYSMGR]                    Utility definition command procedure
    [SYSEXE]                    OSSL program 'openssl'
    [SYSLIB]                    OSSL shareable images
    [SYSTEST]                   IVP command procedure


1 UPGRADE
=prompt An upgrade from a previous OSSL version requires:

That the default OpenSSL configuration file be updated as necessary,
with the corresponding distribution file as an example.  Upgrading or
re-installing OSSL will not overwrite or create a new version of this
file if it has been modified, it will only create the new distribution
file.

1 START_INSTR1
=prompt $ @SYS$STARTUP:OSSL$STARTUP.COM /SYSTEM
1 START_INSTR2
=prompt should be run at system startup, and
1 START_INSTR3
=prompt $ @SYS$STARTUP:OSSL$SHUTDOWN.COM /SYSTEM
1 START_INSTR4
=prompt at system shutdown

When this installation is complete, add a call to OSSL$STARTUP.COM as
shown above to SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_VMS.COM.  Similarly, add a call
to OSSL$SHUTDOWN.COM as shown above to SYS$MANAGER:SYSHUTDWN.COM.

These startup procedures will define the OSSL$ exec mode logical names
to the SYSTEM logical name table and install the OSSL shareable images,
and the shutdown procedure will deinstall the shareable images and
deassign the logical names.

Note: if you installed OSSL off system-disk, i.e. with
/DESTINATION=DISK:[DIR], SYS$STARTUP: should be replaced with
DISK:[DIR.SYS$STARTUP] in the command lines shown above.
